### Work Day Scheduler Starter Code:

This was a BootCamp assigned project in which we where to design a simple calendar application that would save events for each hour of the work day.  It uses Bootstrap, JQuery and grabs the time from Moment.js.  Starter code was supplied but only in the HTML and CSS.  

## Meeting the requirements for the Project:

-This daily planner does list the current day and time at the top of the calendar, supplied by Moment JS

-There are timeblocks for each work day.  They are color-coded to indicate whether it is past, present or future.  They do work and update through the work day. 

-Events are able to be entered and are saved in local storage.  They will be present when page refreshes.

## Reflections
I feel like this project does all that is is meant to do, but I could not figure out how to write it in a way that wasn't totally "copypasta."  With they help of my tutor, my first attempt involved dymanically creating the Calendar block elements... but then I abandoned that approach because figuring out the local storage functionality would be a nightmare. (I did leave it in the comments.) So I just coded them in HTML and ran a SUPER LONG if statement to check them against the current time.  Probably a better way of doing this... but I couldn't think of anything.  Thanks to my Support Tutor Telah Aviya for the help with this.
